# Computational Models of Motion

## Objective

 In this activity you will add the effects of a constant external force to a computational model of motion. Before doing this activity you should have read Section 2.7 of the *Matter and Interactions, 4e* textbook, which discusses the structure of a computational model of changing motion using the **Momentum Principle**.

After completing this activity you should be able to:

1. Identify the portions of a VPython program that 
    * Define the values of constants
    * Specify the masses, initial positions, and initial momenta of the interacting objects
    * Specify the value of Î”t
    * Specify which calculations are to be done iteratively
    * Calculate the net force acting on a system
    * Apply the Momentum Principle to the system
    * Update the position of the system

2. Write a VPython program that predicts and animates the motion of an object that is subject to a constant force.
