# CW10: Motion in a Dipole Field

## Objectives
Dipoles, whether permanent or induced, play a key role in many electric interactions. In chapter 13 we found an analytical expression for the approximate electric field of a dipole at a restricted set of locations along its axis and perpendicular axis but not at other locations. Here you will first calculate the exact electric field of a dipole numerically at many locations, and predict the motion of a proton in a region near a dipole.
After completing this activity you should be able to:

 * Calculate and display the net electric field of several source charges, at many observation locations
 * Animate the motion of one or more charges under the influence of an electric field due to several source charges
 * Monitor the sum of kinetic and potential energy for the system to check the accuracy of model predictions

## Note :

 * You can use either Jupyter notebook or Glowscript. 
 * For Jupter notebook : please write your code in `CW10.ipynb` directly. Do Not create a new file.
 * For Glowscript: please put your Glowscript link in a new cell in `CW10.ipynb`, and also in `README.md`. Make sure your script is public. Do Not create a new file.

    
## Tag : 
    
 * Please tag "cw10" (all lowercase) to the version you want to be graded.
